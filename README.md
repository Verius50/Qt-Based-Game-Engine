# Qt-Based-Game-Engine
My engine, built on the QT framework, enables efficient management of game scenes, freeing you from concerns about memory management. The architecture of the engine grants each scene access to a range of auxiliary managers, including the scene manager, sound manager, time manager, window manager, and input device manager. It is currently in development.
